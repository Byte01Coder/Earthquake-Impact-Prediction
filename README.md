# ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction

## Project Statement:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning-based predictive model that estimates the impact of
earthquakes in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification. The system will utilize geophysical
and environmental data like latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave features, and geological parameters to assess
the possible damage or categorize the earthquake severity. This can help in early disaster planning, emergency
response, and awareness campaigns.

## Use Cases:

**Urban Risk Assessment**

```
Description : Authorities can predict the level of impact an earthquake may cause in populated regions
based on historical data.
Example : Predict which regions are at higher risk during a 5.5 magnitude earthquake using location and
soil type.
```
**Infrastructure Planning**

```
Description : City planners can use the model to guide construction policies in high-risk zones.
Example : Predict risk level based on soil density and proximity to fault lines.
```
**Government Disaster Response**

```
Description : Emergency teams can prioritize regions for response and rescue based on expected impact.
Example : Rank areas for aid delivery after an earthquake hits, using model predictions.
```
**Outcomes:**

```
Understand seismic data and its role in predicting earthquake impacts.
Preprocess and analyze geospatial and geophysical features.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification or regression of earthquake impact.
Optionally deploy the model using a simple user interface.
Document the modelâ€™s performance and results with visualizations.
